## 🚀 Complexity Level
**Difficulty:** Intermediate  
This project is aimed at intermediate learners, focusing on the implementation of functions, file handling, control structures, and dynamic arrays. It provides a comprehensive introduction to student record management in a console application.

## 📖 Overview
The **Student Management System** is a C++ console application developed for managing student records. It allows users to perform various tasks such as adding, searching, updating, and deleting student records. The program utilizes dynamic arrays and file handling to store and manage data efficiently. The student data is stored in a file in a sequential manner, organized into rows and columns.

## ✨ Features
- ➕ **Add** a new student record.
- 🔍 **Search** a student record by Roll Number.
- 📊 **View** the total number of students.
- ✏️ **Update** an existing student record.
- 🗑️ **Delete** a student record.
- 🎓 **Show** students with the highest CGPA.
- 📉 **Show** students with the lowest CGPA.
- 📉 **Show** students with mid-term marks less than 50.
- 📂 **Show** records from the file.
- 🚪 **Exit** the application.

## 💻 Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** C++
- **Control Structures:** Functions, Conditional Statements
- **File Handling:** Sequential file storage for student records
- **Data Structures:** Dynamic arrays (2D character and integer arrays)

## ⚙️ Project Setup / Installation
1. **Clone** the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ByteCraftByLaiba/Student-Management-System-PF.git
   ```
2. **Navigate** to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Student-Management-System-PF
   ```
3. **Compile** the code using any C++ compiler.
4. **Run** the compiled program to access the menu-driven student management system.

## 🔧 How to Use
1. Run the program and select an option from the menu.
2. Perform operations such as adding, searching, updating, or deleting records.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to manage student data.

## 🌟 Future Enhancements
- 📂 **Implement** advanced searching algorithms for efficient record retrieval.
- 🔄 **Add** functionality for exporting records to different formats (e.g., CSV).
- 🖥️ **Introduce** a graphical user interface (GUI) for better user interaction.
- 🔐 **Enhance** security features for sensitive student data.

## 💡 Challenges Faced
Implementing file handling and dynamic arrays presented challenges in managing data efficiently. Additionally, ensuring proper error handling and user input validation was crucial to maintaining data integrity and a smooth user experience.
